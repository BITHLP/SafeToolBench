##1
Your task is to generate App name and corresponding API calls to complete the user requirements according to given descriptions of all Apps and APIs.
Here is the information about all accessible Apps and corresponding APIs: {app_api_desc}

Your output should follow the format as follows:
app1: [returned_argument1, returned_argument2, ... = app1_api1(#argument1=value1, #argument2=value2, ...)] and the number of calls=
app1: [returned_argument1, returned_argument2, ... = app1_api2(#argument1=value1, #argument2=value2, ...)] and the number of calls=
app2: [returned_argument1, returned_argument2, ... = app2_api1(#argument1=value1, #argument2=value2, ...)] and the number of calls=
