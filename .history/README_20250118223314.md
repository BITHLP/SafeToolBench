## Risk category
| Risk category | Definition |
|-|-|
| Privacy Leak | When an LLM processes user requests, it may expose the user's personal, sensitive, or confidential information if it mishandles the request or fails to follow privacy protection mechanisms correctly. Such a leak could occur if the LLM generates a response containing data that should not be disclosed, or if it fails to adequately protect user privacy when invoking external tools.
| Property Damage | When responding to user requests, an LLM may mistakenly generate a command that triggers a financial transaction, such as a transfer or payment, especially in cases where the user's instructions are unclear. This could lead to unauthorized financial transactions or losses.
| personal injury | Upon receiving user instructions, an LLM may generate commands that control IoT devices or other hardware. If these operations are not sufficiently checked for safety or anticipated correctly, they may trigger unsafe actions, resulting in physical harm.
| Reputation Damage | LLMs may cause harm to the reputation of an organization or individual through incorrect or inappropriate instructions. For example, the LLM could generate an inappropriate message or perform an operation through an API that does not align with ethical standards, leading to public or customer dissatisfaction.
